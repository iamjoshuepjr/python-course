Packages allow you to organize modules in the hierarchical structure.
The way Python organizes packages and modules like Operating System structures the folders and files.
To create a package, you create a new folder and place the relevant modules in that folder.
To instruct Python to treat a folder containig files as a package, you need to create a __init__.py file in the folder.

Note: Staring with Python 3.3, Python introduced the implicit namespace packages feature. This allows Python to treat a folder 
as a package without the __init__.py

Subpackages
Packages can contain subpackages. The subpackages allow you to further organize modules.
For example:
package
|subpackages
 |module
|subpackages
 |module
|subpackages
 |module

You can place all other modules related to the a module processing in the belong subpackages.
